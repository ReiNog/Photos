# Photos
Playing with images using python just for fun and to practice when I donÂ´t want to work in serious things<br>
Photo-to-cartoon.py does what the name says, converts a photo to cartoon. <br>
The program shows the created image at each step. User has to press any key to continue.<br>
Code created using OpenCV library <br>
