# Photos
Playing with images using python just for fun and to practice when I donÂ´t want to work in serious things
Photo-to-cartoon.py does what the name says, converts a photo to cartoon. The program shows each of the images. User has to press any key to continue.
Code created using OpenCV library 
And inspiration from www.askpython.com/python/examples/images-into-cartoons and towardsdatascience.com/turn-photos-into-cartoons-using-python-bb1a9f578a7e
